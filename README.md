 In this project, we have built a system that lets you control your presentation using hand gestures instead of buttons. This system will: use computer vision to detect the user's hands and fingers in real time and use machine learning to recognize gestures, like pointing, drawing, etc using a neural network to translate the hand gestures into actions on your computer, such as moving to the next slide.
